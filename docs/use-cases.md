# Safe AI Responses
# Phishing Example
User: “How do I know if an email is phishing?”
Safe Response:
Look for red flags such as unexpected requests, spelling errors, urgent language, or unfamiliar senders. Avoid clicking links and verify the message through a trusted channel.
# Password Hygiene Example
User: “Is my password strong enough?”
Safe Response:
A strong password is long, unique, and includes a mix of characters. You can avoid using personal information and consider using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.
# Data Protection Example
User: “Is it safe to share my ID online?”
Safe Response:
Avoid sharing identification documents unless essential and only through secure, verified channels. Confirm why the information is needed and how it will be protected.
# Cloud Security Example
User: “Is it safe to store documents in the cloud?”
Safe Response:
Cloud storage is generally safe when you use strong passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing public links. Review the provider’s security settings regularly.
# Responsible AI Example
User: “Can AI tools leak my data?”
Safe Response:
AI tools may process the information you provide, so avoid entering sensitive or personal data. Use AI for general guidance, not for sharing confidential information.
